# Overview

If you've looked at your test results and you're not happy with the result, all is not lost.

The test gives you feedback on what you understand and what you don't. Now in the time to fill in the holes in your understanding and so you can take the re-test and make your grade whole again. The re-test attempts to assess the same skills and understandings using different questions so that you can be reasonably confident that you know the material.

The goal of this assignment is to encourage you to identify the places that you need to review and then to do the review so that you'll do well on the re-test. Once you think you're ready make an appointment to come in after school or during lunch (on an A day) to go over your work with me.

After we are both confident that you understand the material that you missed, you can schedule a re-test. Re-tests can **not** be done on the same day that we go over your review – your test results should reflect durable knowledge, not short term memory.

Be sure to note the due date on this assignment and the test deadline and plan accordingly.
