# Instructions

## During Class

1. Start by making a copy of the [review template][template] (click on the link, then make an editable copy (File > Make a copy).
1. For each question that you missed:
  - List it in the table, one question per row in test order. Add additional rows if needed.
  - Indicate your (incorrect) answer.
  - Describe what  the question was assessing (what does the College Board want you to know and/or be able to do).
  - What is the  error you need to avoid or the misunderstanding you need to clear up to get a similar question right on the re-test.

## Homework

Review the topics that you missed – a good way to get started is to look over the Code.Org lessons and their “Check Your Understanding” questions for the unit.

## At Least One Day Before The Re-test Deadline

Submit this review and make an appointment to come in after school or during lunch on an A day to go over your work.
